# üåæ Agriculture Crop Yield Analysis

An academic project for **STA 2101: Statistics & Probability**
**University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)**

---

## üìò Abstract

Agriculture productivity is highly influenced by environmental and climatic factors.
This project analyzes **how temperature, rainfall, humidity, and soil conditions impact crop yields** using the [Agriculture Crop Yield Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelotiattakorah/agriculture-crop-yield).

We apply **statistical and probabilistic methods** from STA 2101 to discover actionable insights for **agricultural planning and decision-making**.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- ‚úÖ Explore correlations between climatic variables and crop yield.
- ‚úÖ Identify key environmental factors that affect yield variation.
- ‚úÖ Perform descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- ‚úÖ Develop probability models for high/low yield prediction.
- ‚úÖ Provide actionable insights for sustainable agriculture.
